# AutolayoutHelper
NSLayoutConstraint is the API used for creating auto layout constraints in code. If you have ever used the API, you know that it can be confusing, and is just a pain to use because of the long methods, and code duplication. This category adds a easy to read wrapper around this API, so you don't have to worry about creating the constraints yourself, you just specify where you want your view positioned, and you are good to go. That being said, you still need to know the rules of auto layout, for example, which view to add a constraint to that adds space between two views.
